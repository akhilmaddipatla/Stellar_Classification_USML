# Stellar_Classification_USML

Our project is about clustering stars based on its features.
Background Check of Star classes!
Stars in the universe can be classified into several groups. The groups I have used here are:
• Brown Dwarf
• Red Dwarf
• White Dwarf
• Main Sequence
• Supergiant
• Hypergiant
The classification of stars is done using a H-R Diagram as shown below above.
But in this project, we will cluster the stars based on all its features using different clustering 
algorithms like K-means and Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering. 
Before applying the algorithm, we will visualize the patterns hidden in the data using t-SNE. 
We will also use dimensionality reduction technique like PCA to obtain the lower dimensional 
data while preserving as much of the data variation as possible.
